Asynchronous FRC Programming Library

Installation
------------

Copy all the files in the src directory into your Java FRC project. From there,
you can check out the [mortorq](http://github.com/CapnKernul/mortorq) for
examples on how to use the library.

How it works
------------

I'll add some examples here soon.

Contributing
------------

 * Fork the project, modify it, send a pull request.
 * File an issue.

All code that _can_ be tested, for example parts of the code that do not use any
cRIO-specific features, must have tests.

I'm open to any suggestions!
